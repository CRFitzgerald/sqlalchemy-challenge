# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this challenge, I use Python and SQLAlchemy ORM queries to perform climate analysis and data exploration on a Hawaiian weather database. 

### Tools Used
* Python
* SQLAlchemy ORM 
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Flask

## Jupyter Notebook Database Connection
1. I used SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to the SQLite database and automap_base to reflect the Measurement and Station tables into classes
2. SQLAlchemy session is used to link Python to the database and session is closed.
